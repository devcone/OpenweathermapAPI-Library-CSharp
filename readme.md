# OpenweathermapAPI-Library-CSharp
A NuGet package which allows easy interaction with the openweathermap API through C#, to make everyone's lives easier. This project has not been uploaded as a NuGet package as it is in early development. The current goal is to retrieve all weather data if the user only has a basic Openweathermap API key and is not on a paid account (This will come in the future! I am a solo dev so it might take a while)
